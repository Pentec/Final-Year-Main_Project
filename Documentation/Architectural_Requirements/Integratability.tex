%Integratability
\subsubsection *{Description:}
	  The Patient Information Management System should be integrated with ease to the Universities website as well as the NHSA web site.
	 \subsubsection *{Justification:}
	   The Patient Information Management System is primarily designed for the kalafong medical staff and is required to be accessable on both the University's website and the NHSA website. For security perposes we limit it's intergaration to just these two sites.
	\subsection *{Mechanism:}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The contracts based decoupling strategy is used to implement integrability and extensibility on the system by providing sections and different functionality between the back end system and the host site. 
	\end{itemize}
