\subsection{Platform}
\subsubsection{Node.js}
PIMS will be deployed in a Node.js environment. Node.js allows for queued inputs and since the system revolves around multiple inputs possibly going through at any particular time this provides a huge advantage over most other systems. Node.js also includes a wide range of modules through NPM(Node package manager). Some examples of these include Express, AngularJS, mongo, mongoose, and many more. Node.js processes programs asynchronously and thus is a no-interrupt driven language. This is as advantage because, as stated above, it allows for queued inputs. Node.js is written in javascript which means it is ubiquitous which is an obvious advantage.

Node.js relies heavily on callbacks to allow for synchronization which is an obvous hinderance for programmers that are not strong with recursion or callbacks. Although this con is outweighed by the advantages of the system.

\subsection{Databases}
\subsubsection{Database(s)}
\begin{itemize}
	\item MongoDB - is a NoSQL document store. MongoDB is used especially for applications that need store large volumes of data, which is mandatory for PIMS. \\
	MongoDB ensures that scalability, a critical requirement, is enforced. This is due to the highly cache-able persistence environment. Concurrency is also handled  via the locking mechanisms. Multiple read access and a single write operation is allowed.
\end{itemize}
	

\subsection{Object Data Model}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Mongoose - is an object modelling environment for MongoDB and Node.js. It enforces contracts and structure via validation, provides connection pooling, which improves scalability. Automatic object to document mappings is also supported.
\end{itemize}
