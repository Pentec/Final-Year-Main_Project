The Kalafong PIMS will need to be integrated with:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The NHLS website in order to retrieve diagnostic codes form the website
		\begin{itemize}
			\item This functionality is to be executed at a later stage, outside the realms of the project
		\end{itemize}
	\item The University of Pretoria website by linking the two websites
	\item The existing departmental Microsoft Access database
	\item The individual datasets that will be part of the system
\end{itemize}
