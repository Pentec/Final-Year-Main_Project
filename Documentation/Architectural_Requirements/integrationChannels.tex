The PIMS will need to be integrated with:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The NHLS website in order to retrieve diagnostic codes form the website
		\begin{itemize}
			\item This functionality is to be executed at a later stage, outside the scope of the COS 301 Main Project.
	\item The University of Pretoria website by linking the two websites
	\item The existing departmental Microsoft Access database
	\item The individual datasets that will be part of the system
\end{itemize}
