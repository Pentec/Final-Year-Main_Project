The Module Pattern pulls from some major principles  of object-oriented programming, namely encapsulation and abstraction \cite{davidsevcik}. It enforces data encapsulation by constraining a module to one file and it provides the client of a module with only the public API methods of the module. This avoids JavaScript's public/private variable scoping. For abstraction, the module pattern provides a layer of abstraction for the client. As a result, whichever client that uses a module does not have to concern themselves with the process of instantiating the module. An interface is then defined between the client and the module and all the client has to be concerned with is knowing the parameters of the module constructor as well as the api of the returned instance.
