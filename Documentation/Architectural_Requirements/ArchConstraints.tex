\begin{itemize}
	\item The architecture is largely constrained to node.js and MongoDB.
	\item Due to the nature of node.js' single-threaded processing there may be an impact on performance, but this will be balanced out with the use of other performance-driven technologies, such as MongoDB.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Data exchange format}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The transfer of data between the server and client side as well as from the database will primarily be in JSON format, particularly due to the nature of the MongoDB database data format.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Neural Network}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The operation of the feed-forward neural network is to allow for background calculations that must be propagated to the user interface in a user-friendly and eye-pleasing manner. As a result, the neural network must have not only a back-end for calculation but a front-end aspect as well. An npm Neural Network package that works in browsers is used to address this aspect.
