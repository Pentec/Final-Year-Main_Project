\subsubsection*{Description}
The PIMS should be easily Maintainable in future; thus making it flexible and extensible.
		
\subsubsection*{Justification}
Software always needs new features or bug fixes. Maintainable software is easy to extend and fix, which encourages the software's uptake and use.
	
\subsubsection*{Mechanism}	
\begin{enumerate}
\item Strategy:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Open-source resources:} using open source resources to minimize update costs in the future.
		\item \textbf{Iterative development and regular reviews:} This will help us improve system quality.
		\item \textbf{External code review:} Here we get external people, preferably those more experienced, to review the implementation, to ensure that it is clean and has loose coupling. The cleaner and less coupled the implementation, the better it is to maintain.
		\item \textbf{Version control:} This will help keep our code, tests and documentation up to date and synchronised. It will also help us keep track of progress.
		\item \textbf{Documentation} Relevant documentation will help future developers understand the software and system as a whole.
		\item \textbf{Service Contracts:} \ref{sec:contracts} Strict adherence to contract specifications will aid system extensibility.
\end{itemize}
