\item the system administrator
\item the project administrators
\item the medical staff
\item the usability test subjects
\end{description}

\subsection{Applicability}
This Software User Manual (SUM) applies to the PIMS software, version 0.1.\\


\subsection{Purpose}
The purpose of the SUM is to assist the user in installing and using the PIMS software.\\

	
\subsection{How to use this document}
\begin{description}
\item How it is to be used:
\item[$\bullet$]  Chapter 2 - Overview of PIMS Software
\item[$\bullet$] Chapter 3 - tutorials
\item[$\bullet$] references of the complete PIMS software
\end{description}

	
\subsubsection{Problem Reporting}
Since the Pentec team will be dissolved after completion of the PIMS project, the
issue of problem reporting is left to the Administrator, Professor Snyman.\\
	

\section{Overview}
The purpose of this software is to be used by doctors and medical staff. It allows the administrative users to electronically fill in medical forms and be able to query for statistics for those forms and eventually receive a prediction that could assist in the functionality of the Kalafong Hospital. Regular users are allowed to fill in medical forms.
