\begin{description}
\item[$\bullet$] The client, agent and dispatcher operations are described in this chapter. The description of
the syntax of the operations needs an explanation:
\item[$\bullet$]  [ arg ]: Parameters between 145 the symbols ”[” and ”]” mean that these are optional. Note
that the symbols itself are never used.
\item[$\bullet$] ( arg0 | arg1 | ... | argn ): Parameters between the symbols ”(” and ”)” and the symbol
” | ” betweens those parameters, mean that one of the parameters from arg0 to argn
must be chosen. Note that the symbols itself are never used.
