\section{PIMS Login Module}
This module is responsible for allowing a user to login into and Logout out of Pentec Patient Information Management System. A user should login with the credentials they were assigned upon registration. If the user is not assigned a username then an exception is thrown and the user is redirected to the login page. \par 

To avoid "Spambots", a CAPTCHA challenge is used.
