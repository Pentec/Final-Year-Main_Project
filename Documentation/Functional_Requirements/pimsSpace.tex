\subsubsection{Use cases}
\begin{description}
	\item{\textbf{getPIMSSpace:}}
		\begin{description} Provides the user with the front-end of the PIMS; two spaces exist given the user's privileges. If a user is an administrator, they are provided with a space with features designed for them. The same applies for normal uses, who have fewer features than the administrator.
		\item{\textbf{Service Contract}} Below is a detailed service contract of how a PIMS Space is provided to the user and the actions that follow their requests.

	\item{viewTutorial:} This provides users with a different tutorials: a video tutorial that covers all the core functionality, an image tutorial with the most critical functionality, and a user-manual that provides a detailed explanation of PIMS.
	\item{addNewUser:} This functionality is only for the administrator; normal users cannot access this page and are redirected to their respective PIMS space. This allows for the addition of new users to the system; access rights are also
