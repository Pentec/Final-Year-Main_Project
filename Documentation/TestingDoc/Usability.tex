\subsubsection*{Description}
The PIMS should be easily Maintainable in future. Thus needs to be flexible and extensible.
		
\subsubsection*{Justification}
Software always needs new features or bug fixes. Maintainable software is easy to extend and fix, which encourages the software's uptake and use.
	
	
\subsubsection*{Mechanism}	
\begin{enumerate}
\item Strategy:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Open-source resources: using open source resources to minimize update costs in the future.
		\item Iterative development and regular reviews: This will help us improve system quality.
		\item Prevention is better than cure: Here we get others(lecturers) to review your code, to make sure its clean.The cleaner our code, the cheapre it is to maintain.
		\item Version control:Thsi will help keep our code, tests and documentation up to date and synchronised. It will also help us keep track of progress.
		\item Documentation: Relevant documentation will help future developers understand the software and system as a whole.
\end{itemize}
