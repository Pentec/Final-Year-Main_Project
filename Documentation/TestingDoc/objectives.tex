Testing was done on the system mainly for the following 5 reasons:

\begin{itemize}
	\item To ensure that the system meets both functional and non functional requirements arroding to the given spesifications
	\item System stress, that is to make sure that the system does not fail with multiple users or any other factors because it is expensive to resolve and fix at a later stage.
	\item To handle and resolve System failures and bugs appropriatly and in good time.
	\item To point out the defects and errors that were made during and after the development phases.
	\item To ensure that the final product is of top, professiona, software engineering standards.
\end{itemize}
